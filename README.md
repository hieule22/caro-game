# Caro Game

This repository contains my Java implementation of the popular Asian board game
(Gomoku)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku]. The Java compiler and Java Runtime
Environment (downloadable from this
[Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/downloads/index.html#java)
website) are needed to install and run the game.
